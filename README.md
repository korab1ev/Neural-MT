# To-do:

1. __Solutions & ways to impove BLEU__:
- Noisy channel model
- Reinforcement learning
- Globally normalized models
2. __Local length normalization__ (the model is bias towards shorter candidates)
3. __Visualise attentions__
4. __Try bidirectional encoder__
5. __Try reversing the input sequence in the encoder__ (vanilla enc-dec architecture, find the article)
